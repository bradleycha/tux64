tux64-rescompiler is a collection of command-line tools used by tux64-boot to
convert binary data into C source code which can be linked with the rest of the
program.

This contains three subprojects, which get configured, built, and installed
automatically from the parent working directory.  Thus, you shouldn't have to
manually configure/make/install these.

   tux64-fontcompiler  - Converts a font map image into compressed binary data
                         used by the stage-1 framebuffer console.

   tux64-textcompiler  - Encodes ASCII text into the embedded form for the
                         stage-1 framebuffer console.

   tux64-imagecompiler - Converts a 64x64 image into a compressed format which
                         can be rendered in the stage-1 framebuffer console.

For more information, refer to the above projects' README files.
