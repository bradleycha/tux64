tux64-rescompiler is a collection of command-line tools used by tux64-boot to
convert binary data into C source code which can be linked with the rest of the
program.

This contains two subprojects, which get configured, built, and installed
automatically from the parent working directory.  Thus, you shouldn't have to
manually configure/make/install these.

   tux64-fontcompiler - Converts a font map image into compressed binary data
                        used by the stage-1 framebuffer console.

   tux64-textcompiler - Encodes ASCII text into the embedded form for the
                        stage-1 framebuffer console.

For more information, refer to the above projects' README files.
