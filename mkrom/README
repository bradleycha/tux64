tux64-mkrom is a command-line tool used to create a bootable Nintendo 64 ROM
image which contains a bootloader, kernel, initramfs, and root filesystem.  This
ROM image can then either be used in emulators, flash carts, or flashed directly
to a ROM chip and run on real hardware.  For more information, run tux64-mkrom
without any arguments to display the help menu.
