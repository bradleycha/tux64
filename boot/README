tux64-boot is a Linux bootloader for the Nintendo 64.  It compiles binary code
files required for different stages of the bootloader.  The binary files are
intended to be used with tux64-mkrom to create a Nintendo 64 ROM image which can
boot and run Linux.

The following files are created:
   
   * stage0.bin - The code to run in place of the IPL3 and perform basic
                  hardware initialization required for stage 1.

   * stage0.bin.cic - Data placed at the end of RSP DMEM to force the CIC
                      checksum to match the CIC-6102's IPL3 checksum.  This is
                      required in order to boot on real hardware.

   * stage1.bin - The main bootloader binary.  This is what most users will
                  interact with and contains most of the bootloader code.

   * stage2.bin - The code used to free stage 1 from memory and load the kernel,
                  initramfs, and command-line into main memory and start the
                  kernel.

In order to build this, you will need a cross-compiler which can target
mips64-elf.  To accomplish this, please refer to the installation instructions
for Tux64.
