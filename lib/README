tux64-lib, also called libtux64, is a library containing shared code used
across all Tux64 programs.  This code is highly dependent on configuration
variables, as its designed to run on the build system, bootloader, and Nintendo
64.  Thus, take care when running the configure command, as a misconfiguration
can easily lead to lots of breakage and madness.
